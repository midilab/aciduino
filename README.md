# Aciduino

The DIY Arduino-based Roland TB303 and TR808 Step Sequencer clone and MIDI Controller. Designed using readily available, inexpensive parts. It can be easily assembled on a protoboard or [ordered as PCB](https://pushermanproductions.com/product/midilab-aciduino-303-style-midi-sequencer-pcb-only/). 

There are two flavors of aciduino, the [first version(v1)](https://github.com/midilab/aciduino/tree/master/v1/) is a TB303 sequencer only, the [second version(v2)](https://github.com/midilab/aciduino/tree/master/v2/) is a TB303 and TR808 sequencer with oled display and step/pattern/mute grid system.

Features
========

### 303/808 Step Sequencer clone

Programming bass and drum steps using same analogy of original machines • Save your pattern work on microcontroller EPPROM memory for later live gigs • Use step length and shift to make some unusual sequences • Automation grid system for step edit, pattern navigation and mute tracks • Realtime and Step record modes for MIDI keyboard input(v2 only)

### Professional grade Clock

Tight and solid clock system using hardware timers to achieve realtime professional grade tick system • Send or receive clock to keep all your external equipment synced

### Generative Engine

Generate new and fresh acid music patterns by pressing a single button and twist some parameters • Harmonizer to force musical harmonic modes for bass lines • Euclidian generator for drum parts

### Midi Controller

Controls up to 16 parameters per track of your external synthesizers(bass/drums) • Midi learn(v2 only) • 16 potentiometers modular support to extend aciduino as midi controller(v2 only)

### Pattern memory

Store your patterns conveniently on the microcontroller's EEPROM, allowing you to access them effortlessly during live performances.
