# Aciduino V2

Put your DIY super powers to the test building your own Roland's TB-303 and/or TB-808 step sequencer! An Arduino based clone project specially hacked with corrosive features to improve live performances! Save your money building the classic and timeless TB-303 and TR-808 step sequencer clone faster than a blink of an eye.

This version is multi-architecture, allowing for the use of different microcontrollers in the build. Currently, it supports Arduino Mega, any Teensy >= 3.2, and ESP32(tested on wroom dev kit only for now).

Aciduino V2 is also the first official [uMODULAR](https://github.com/midilab/uMODULAR) app, leveraging uMODULAR schematics, [uCtrl](https://github.com/midilab/uCtrl) drivers/interface library, and [uClock](https://github.com/midilab/uClock) BPM clock generator.

# Download

The recommended way for aciduino users is to make use of release pack on [Releases area](https://github.com/midilab/aciduino/releases), make sure to download the one named aciduino-v2_xxx.zip, where xxx is the version released.  
  
If you want to get the latest on the edge features and keep in track with development of aciduino you can make use of git version via clone.  
  
As this version utilizes uCtrl and uClock libraries as submodules, please remember to initialize the submodules immediately after cloning the repository.  

```console
you@acidlab:~$ git clone https://github.com/midilab/aciduino.git
you@acidlab:~$ cd aciduino/
you@acidlab:~$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```  

Open v2/AciduinoV2/AciduinoV2.ino and uncomment only one of the following microcontroller ports depending on wich one you're going to use.

```c
...
//
// Select your platform port
//
//#include "src/ports/esp32/wroom.h"
//#include "src/ports/esp32/s3.h"
#include "src/ports/avr/mega.h"
//#include "src/ports/teensy/protoboard.h"
//#include "src/ports/esp32/wroom-ext1.h"
//#include "src/ports/teensy/uone.h"
//#include "src/ports/avr/midilab_mega.h"
//#include "src/ports/avr/afourtrackmind_mega.h"
...
```

# Compile

Know to work environments:  

ESP32: Espressif Arudino Core >= 3.0.5

Aciduino v2 brings new acid elements such as 808 step sequencer and a generative engine based on euclidian algorithm for great acid drums ideas.

A oled screen to get access to all parameters that matters in realtime, a easy to edit grid system for 808 and 303.

## How to use?

Please reffer to [user manual](https://github.com/midilab/aciduino/tree/master/v2/docs/aciduinoV2-midi_sequencer-user_manual.md)

## Assembly

Place the buttons, knob and powerlines
